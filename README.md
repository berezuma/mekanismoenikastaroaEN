# Mechanisms & Machines - Online Course

A standalone, interactive web-based course designed to teach high school students the fundamentals of mechanical engineering, motion transmission, and machine elements. This project is contained within a single HTML file, utilizing embedded CSS for styling and Vanilla JavaScript for interactive logic.

## Project Overview

* **Author:** Beñat Erezuma
* **Target Audience:** High School Students / STEM Beginners
* **Format:** Single-page Application (SPA) structure
* **License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Adaptive layout with a sticky sidebar for desktop and simplified navigation for mobile devices.
* **Interactive Navigation:** JavaScript-based section switching without page reloads.
* **Visual Learning:** Integrated diagrams and images from Wikimedia Commons to illustrate concepts.
* **Assessment Tools:**
* **Interactive Exercises:** Input-based calculation problems with immediate feedback logic.
* **Knowledge Quiz:** Multiple-choice assessment with scoring and progress tracking.


* **Calculators:** Built-in logic to validate answers for mechanical advantage, gear ratios, and speed calculations.

## Usage Instructions

1. Download the source code.
2. Save the file with an `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
3. Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
4. No internet connection is required for the code logic, though images are hotlinked from external sources (Wikimedia) and require a connection to load.

## Course Curriculum

The content is organized into five main modules:

### 1. Fundamentals

* **Introduction:** Course goals and structure.
* **Key Definitions:** Machines, mechanisms, and mechanical advantage ().
* **Parts of a Machine:** Driving element, mechanism, driven element.
* **Types of Motion:** Linear, Circular, Reciprocating, Oscillating.

### 2. Transmission Mechanisms

* **Levers:** Classes 1, 2, and 3; Law of Levers calculation.
* **Pulleys:** Fixed, movable, and block & tackle systems.
* **Gears:** Spur, bevel, and helical gears; transmission ratios ().
* **Chain Drive:** Bicycle and industrial applications.
* **Belt Drive:** Pulley systems and speed reduction.
* **Worm Gear:** Perpendicular axis transmission and high reduction ratios.

### 3. Transformation Mechanisms

* **Rack & Pinion:** Converting circular motion to linear.
* **Cams & Eccentrics:** Creating complex/irregular motion profiles.
* **Crank & Connecting Rod:** Converting linear to circular (and vice versa).

### 4. Real Applications

* **Steam Engine:** History, components, and operation cycle.
* **Gasoline Engine:** The four-stroke cycle (Intake, Compression, Combustion, Exhaust).
* **Bicycle Mechanics:** Gear ratios, efficiency, and human power transmission.

### 5. Assessment

* **Exercises:** Mathematical problems regarding lever forces, gear speeds, and pulley loads.
* **Quiz:** Conceptual questions to test retention.

## Technical Details

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure using `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside>`.
* **CSS3:** Custom variables (`:root`) for consistent theming, Flexbox/Grid for layout, and media queries for responsiveness.
* **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation, event listeners, and calculation logic. No external libraries or frameworks are used.
